            <h3>Thoughts on using Google Drive for this Class</h3><br>
            <p>I thought using Google Drive was a very smooth way to handle this class. I very much liked how all the code samples from class was able to be put in Google Drive, and that was very helpful for me as I did the homework. My one critique was that the deadlines wouldn't show up on Canvas, but I could have manually put the deadlines in. I guess that shows how little of an issue it was; it was inconvenient enough to bring it up, yet not enough to make me do anything about. Overall, I thought using Google Drive fit the goals of this course very well.</p><br>

            <h3>Groupwork VS Indiviual Work</h3><br>
            <p>Overall, I was happy with my teammate. We could have done more together as a team, and tended to let the other teammate take the whole assignment and take turns doing that. That would lead to me being a bit confused on the next assignment when he had done the previous one, and it would take 30ish minutes to understand what the previous code meant. It was very nice to have that collaboration with the teams, and I generally prefered it to working alone. I did feel like I was able to buckle down and get more done on the tests and final exam when I was working alone, but I don't think I would have liked it for the whole course to be like that.</p> <br>

            <h3>How were the Tests and Workload?</h3> <br>
            <p>I thought the tests were rather difficult, but I still felt like we had learned all the techniques we needed for them. They generally reqiured me analytical thought and brain power than the homework assignments did. The workload felt like a good sweetspot. I was able to continually work on this course so I would be using what I learned, but I didn't totally speed through it. I feel like there was a good amount of time between when the assignments were due.</p> <br>

            <h3>Troubles using XAMPP</h3><br>
            <p>I didn't have any issues installing XAMPP or getting it to run on my computer. I am currently using Windows 11, but I was using Windows 10 when I set XAMPP up, so safe to say it is working on both operating systems.</p> <br>

            <h3>Is there anything else I wish we covered?</h3><br>
            <p>I feel like I have a decent foundation on how to use databases now. I don't think I know everything about them, but I could make my own database and store data in it if I needed to. I am not very confident with joins, so I wish we did a whole assignment using joins.</p> <br>

            <h3>Cool Ideas for Assignments</h3><br>
            <p>I didn't have any ideas right now that I think would be super cool for this class. I think this class did a good job with keeping the tasks interesting.</p> <br>
